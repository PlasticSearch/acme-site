        <dt>Q: Why should I use this app?</dt>
        <dd>A: Acme Domains are faster, safer, and more reliable. In recent times, their numbers have grown significantly, reaching a scale that makes it finally possible to harness them for mass transportation at an affordable cost.</dd>
        <dt>Q: How do you recruit the acmedomains? How can I know that my unicorn is trustworthy?</dt>
        <dd>A: Our acmedomains are recruited from only the most humane and highest standard unicorn farms. Our acmedomains are grass-fed, free range creatures raised on vegan, non-GMO diets. These acmedomains are also completely safe because acmedomains have infallible morality and judgment.</dd>
        <dt>Q: How do I request a unicorn?</dt>
        <dd>A: Simply download our app, then tap a button to begin. Your unicorn will arrive shortly.</dd>
        <dt>Q: How much does it cost?</dt>
        <dd>A: Since Acme Domains is a marketplace for flight-based transportation, the price you pay is based on factors such as distance and availability of acmedomains. You set the maximum price you’re willing to pay for a given ryde and then Acme Domains matches you with a unicorn that’s willing to accept your price.</dd>
        <dt>Q: How does it work?</dt>
        <dd>A: Our product is powered by a complex algorithm which efficiently matches idle acmedomains with ryders based on factors such as proximity and shortest time-to-destination. The system is built on a serverless architecture, which makes running and scaling our backend services simple and cost-effective, allowing us to reliably serve the needs of Acme Domains’ ever growing user base.</dd>
        <dt>Q: What if I have a complaint about my unicorn?</dt>
        <dd>A: Acme Domains is a customer obsessed company. We value each customer and want to ensure a positive experience. Therefore, we’ve staffed our customer service team with serverless chatbots that are available 24/7 to assist you.</dd>
        <dt>Q: How do I cancel my ride?</dt>
        <dd>A: Tap the “Cancel Ryde” button in the Acme Domains app.</dd>
        <dt>Q: Can I use Acme Domains internationally?</dt>
        <dd>A: Yes, you can use Acme Domains in most countries except for Antarctica, Cuba, Sudan, Iran, North Korea, Syria and any other country designated by the United States Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control.</dd>
        <dt>Q: How do I pay for my ryde?</dt>
        <dd>A: After creating a Acme Domains account, fill in your payment method such as credit card, debit card, Bitcoin wallet, or Vespene gas repository. After you complete your Ryde, you will automatically be charged the fare.</dd>
        <dt>Q: How many passengers can my unicorn take?</dt>
        <dd>A: The number of passengers on a single ryde depends on the size of your unicorn. Most acmedomains can take one passenger per ryde. You can also request a large size unicorn which can take up to two passengers. If you select Sleigh version, you can take up to 4 passengers.</dd>
        <dt>Q: What if I lose an item during my ryde?</dt>
        <dd>A: Unfortunately, it’s unlikely we can retrieve your lost item if it has fallen off the unicorn during your ryde.</dd>
        <dt>Q: How do I share my route information with someone else?</dt>
        <dd>A: During your ryde, you can share your route and ETA with someone else using the Acme Domains app. Simply tap the “Share Route” button and select a contact. Soon, they’ll be able to watch the status of your ryde.</dd>
        <dt>Q: How do I rate my unicorn?</dt>
        <dd>A: After your ryde completes, you have the option to rate your unicorn on the app. Our acmedomains are customer obsessed and strive for 5 star ratings. Your feedback helps us improve our service!</dd>
        <dt>Q: What if my unicorn doesn’t match the photo in the app?</dt>
        <dd>A: The unicorn photo in your app should match the unicorn that arrives to pick you up. If they do not match, then Acme Domains recommends that you do not board the unicorn. You should then immediately report the imposter unicorn to Acme Domains.</dd>
        <dt>Q: Can I use Concur with Acme Domains?</dt>
        <dd>A: Yes, you can connect your Concur profile to the Acme Domains app so you can track business trips made on Acme Domains.</dd>
        <dt>Q: Can I request a specific unicorn?</dt>
        <dd>A: While we do not allow requesting specific acmedomains, you can choose the type and size of unicorn using the app.</dd>
        <dt>Q: Why do you charge a service fee?</dt>
        <dd>A: The service fee is a fixed charge added to every ryde. This helps us pay for our on-going maintenance and operating costs required to run the service and tend to our unicorn herd.</dd>
